  <h2>What is Battle Royale?</h2>
    <p>Battle Royale is a kind of sub-genre of game types. The premise of Battle Royale is to be the last man standing. In most versions of the game mode there are 100 players who drop out of a plane, land on the ground and have to scavenge for loot to survive. However there is a catch, every couple of minutes or so there is a circle that shrinks and pushes the players towards the middle of the map so that it encourages players to move and get into certain locations. If you are outside of this circle you’ll slowly start to die. What makes the game intriguing is once you win you are declared the best of the lobby of players and that is what keeps players coming back is that feeling you get after winning against 99 other players. The origin of the Battle Royale mode is a hotly debated topic as some say H1Z1 popularized the game mode but I would personally argue that Minecraft Hunger Games mod was what started it all. Some of the most prominent Battle Royale games include PUBG(Player Unkown's Battlegrounds), Fortnite, and <a href="callofduty.html">Call of Duty</a> has their own versions of it.

  <h2>Info</h2>
    <p>Battle Royale is quickly becoming THE prominent game mode, as a lot of companies are starting to include a Battle Royale mode in their games. Some main examples if this would be EA’s Battlefield V, Activison’s Call of Duty, and another EA game called Apex Legends which is free to play. Probably the most popular Battle Royale would be Epic Games’ Fortnite. Fortnite has taken over gaming as of late and for good reason too. The game is addicting to play and is fast paced so that you almost never get bored. Kids are getting addicted to this game all over the world and it isn’t going to stop soon. I believe that the popularity in these games is because of how simple they are to play and understand.</p>
  <h2>Why I like it so much</h2>
    <p>I think that the main reason I enjoy Battle Royale games so much is because most of them are free to play and most of them are extremely fun. The main reason I hop on to play a Battle Royale game is to play with friends and the genre makes it super convenient to play with friends. There is something satisfying about winning a match of a Battle Royale that makes you want to get even better and win more games. It’s super competitive and that’s what I like about it. If you want to hop into a Battle Royale I 100% recommend it.</p>
