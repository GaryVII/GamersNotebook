  <h2>What is Gamers Notebook?</h2>
  <p>
    Gamers Notebook is a website created by me, Garrett Castoldi, to share my knowledge on video games and other related topics.
    On this website I will go over; My favorite games that I have played on the <a href="rankings.html">Game Rankings</a> page, I will talk about Halo and
    how influential the game has been for me and many of the other games to come after it on the <a href="halo.html">Halo</a> page, I will discuss
    Call of Duty and how it redefined multiplayer games for me on the <a href="callofduty.html">Call of Duty</a> page, I will also discuss battle royal and how
    this sub genre of games has taken over the market as of late on the <a href="battleroyale.html">Battle Royale</a> page, I will talk about the pc and console communities
    and their differences on the <a href="pcvsconsole.html">PC vs Console</a> page, I will talk about some of the latest technologies and my opinions on them on the <a href="tech.html">Tech</a>, and lastly I will have a
    <a href="form.html">Form</a> for you fill out to suggest some topics to add to my website.
  </p>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of this website is for me to share my opinions and my ideas with the public in hopes of sparking discussion. I hope for this better my knowledge
    of video games and tech and I hope for it to be seen as a site that gives the real truths about some of these games and the technologies. In the end I hope for
    this site to introduce others to my favorite games and technologies and for others to tell me about their favorites in the <a href="form.html">Form</a>.
