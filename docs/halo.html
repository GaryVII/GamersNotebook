    <h2>Campaign/Storyline</h2>
      <p>Halo is a FPS (First Person Shooter), similar to <a href="callofduty.html">Call of Duty</a> that takes place far in the future, you play as a character named Master Chief (John-117)
        who is a super soldier enlisted in the UNSC (United Nations Space Command).
        <p>“In the year 2525, human worlds come under attack by a theocratic alliance of alien races known as the Covenant.
        The Covenant leadership declares humanity heretics and an affront to their gods— the Forerunners—and begin a genocidal holy war. The Covenant's superior technology and numbers prove decisive
        advantages; though effective, the Spartans are too few in number to turn the tide of battle in humanity's favor. After the Covenant invade Reach, the UNSC's last major stronghold besides Earth,
        the Spartan Master Chief John 117 is left one of the few remaining Spartans” (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(franchise)">Wikipedia</a>)</p> The story aspect of this game is one that I enjoy thoroughly and I
        recommend it to many people.</p>
    <h2>Info</h2>
      <p>Halo is a game that was released on the original XBOX as a launch title, so that limited the scope of who could play it because they needed to own an XBOX. Microsoft, the company who created the
        XBOX, bought out Bungie the developers of the original Halo trilogy and that is why it was an XBOX exclusive. Learn more about XBOX and consoles on the <a href="pcvsconsole.html">PC vs Console</a> page.</p>
    <h2>Why I like it so much</h2>
        <p>The main reason I enjoy Halo so much and why it comes into #3 on <a href="rankings.html">My Rankings</a> list is because of the multiplayer. The multiplayer in the game is what defined me as a gamer today.
          The competitiveness of the game and how much fun it was helped me play for hours on end. I played the original trilogy by Bungie a lot but when the 4th installment came out, which was published by 343i, I fell
          in love all over again. I was older and able to play at a more competitive level so that is what I did. Me and my friends everyday after school would grind Halo 4 like our lives depended on it. It was during the
          best time of my life, no worries other than Halo.</p>
