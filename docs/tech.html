    <h2>My Favorite Technologies</h2>
<p>Technology is something that I love. I have alway been fascinated with computers and technologies since I was a child. This fascination has led me to pursue a degree in digital culture where I get to explore all kinds of technologies old and new. When it comes to tech I definitely have my favorites which would include gaming consoles, specifically the Xbox, Apple’s iPad, and VR. First, I like the Xbox because it was one of my first hands on experience with video games and I have a lot of great memories on the Xbox console - learn more about consoles on this <a href="pcvsconsole.html">Page</a>. Second, I like Apple’s iPad because I found it so cool to have, essentially,  a whole computer in such a small form factor. Lastly, VR (Virtual Reality) is probably the coolest technology that has come out in the last decade. Being able to throw on a headset and go into another dimension is the most thrilling experience ever. </p>
<h2>Upcoming Technologies</h2>
<p>Technology is always evolving which means there is always going to be something new and better than the last. One technology that I am always impressed by, and recently just released some new information on, is Microsoft's Xbox Series X. This is the newest iteration of gaming consoles and it's going to be a big one. You can watch the announcement trailer on the left of the screen. Earlier I mentioned VR, which is a technology that is rapidly evolving, and I always like researching and contemplating the reality of full dive VR. Which is a version of VR where the player would be fully involved and be able to feel and react to everything in the game as if it was really happening. Technology is something that is never certain as it is always changing.</p>
