  <h2>Campaign/Storyline</h2>
    <p>Call of Duty is a FPS (First Person Shooter), similar to <a href="halo.html">Halo</a> that has been going on for many years starting with the first one titled “Call of Duty” and it was published by Activision and developed by Infinity Ward. The main premise of the Call of Duty games is you are a military soldier fighting the “bad guys”. The campaigns of the Call of Duty’s are fun but my favorite series, at least for the story,  was the BlackOps series developed by Treyarch.</p>
    <p>"Set in the 1960s during the Cold War, the game's campaign follows CIA operative Alex Mason as he attempts to recall certain memories in combat in order to locate a numbers station. This station is due to transmit broadcasts to sleeper agents who are bound to use chemical weapons across the United States. Mason and CIA operative Jason Hudson are the game's main playable characters, as well as Red Army soldier Viktor Reznov in only one
      mission" (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
  <h2>Info</h2>
    <p>Call of Duty has a total of 16 titles and it is one of the biggest console games ever released. Every year a new Call of Duty game releases and it becomes the top grossing game every year, with games like that they have to be at least somewhat good right? Well it is true the games are good and the people who don’t like them either don’t like the fps genre or they are just a hater. Call of Duty is known mainly for its multiplayer aspect because that is where the majority of the players time is going to be taken up. Most of my time playing Call of Duty was on console and even the pros play the game on console, learn more about consoles on the <a href="pcvsconsole.html">PC vs Console</a> page. The game is extremely competitive and it has its own esports organization known as the CDL (Call of Duty League) which is one of my favorite things to watch while it is in season. </p>
  <h2>Why I like it so much</h2>
    <p>Call of Duty, like Halo, holds a special place in my heart as one of the games in on <a href="rankings.html">My Rankings</a> list. The Call of Duty game that I enjoy the most is Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. The reason I enjoyed this Call of Duty more than the others is because I found myself being really good at it straight from the start. Me and a friend of mine were able to reach the highest rank via leveling and in the competitive scene in no time. I’ve never been able to do that in a Call of Duty game before but in this one I could just play for hours and hours. I have a lot of great memories in this game and i wish more people enjoyed the jetpacks as much as I did.</p>
