    <h2>What is a console?</h2>
      <p>A console, in its most literal definition, is a computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play. Almost every teenager or young adult owns a Playstation or an Xbox which is why gaming is so popular especially in this day and age of technology. Consoles are the simplest form of video game entertainment other than on a smartphone because consoles are essentially “plug and play”. This “plug and play” functionality of consoles is what makes them extremely popular and makes them the go to for gifts to give people. Consoles are also relatively cheap for their functionalities which is another reason they are popular. A part of their popularity is the games <a href="halo.html">Halo</a> and <a href="callofduty.html">Call of Duty</a> which are HUGE console games, not nearly as many players on PC. A main factor in that is that Halo and Call of Duty didn’t really have PC support until recently.</p>
    <h2>What is a PC?</h2>
      <p>A PC or Personal Computer is a multi-purpose computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. While these computers are a little bit more expensive than consoles, if you want a high end machine, and they are a lot more difficult to get setup and to organize the setting for optimal performance. The prices for a PC range from $800-$1,500 for a decent machine and $1,500-$10,000 for high end gaming PCs. While consoles are around $300-$600, their functionality is limited compared to a PC. </p>
    <h2>Why the argument?</h2>
    <p>Ever since I can remember there has always been the PC vs Console debate, mostly everyone stating that PC is the best of the best to which I kind of agree with. I agree with this because the PC gaming experience is one that, if done right, can change your outlook on games and they are meant to be played. Consoles have limits on how good of quality they can put out whereas on PC the only limit is how much money you can spend on a gaming rig. However, for how much a console costs the graphic fidelity is pretty good.</p>
    <p>All in all the argument is quite pointless, it is all up to preference and the amount of money one can put into the hobby. I prefer PCs because the cost of games seems to be lower andthe amount of free games is infinitely more abundant on PC than on console, plus I have a $2,000 gaming PC so I like to lean towards the PC.</p>
